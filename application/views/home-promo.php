<p>So, you've got yourself some home-owners or renters insurance. But, what happens if the worst happens?
Say, a burgular breaks in and takes a bunch of your stuff, or a natural disaster happens? How would you
know what all there is to report? Due to the nature of the problem, keeping inventory in a document on
your computer or a notebook in your closet is not an option. Use Stockpyle to keep track of your home
inventory.</p>
<p>Stockpyle is and always will be totally free to use.</p>
