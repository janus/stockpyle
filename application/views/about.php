	<h2>About StockPyle</h2>
	<p>StockPyle is the Internet's first, Web 2.0 personal inventory tracking system, built specifically
		to keep users protected in case of a catastrophe. We will store your information on a safe and
		secure server available for online access whenever you need it. Once you are ready to send in
		the information to your insurance company (or do whatever else you would like to do with it),
		you can simply print off a PDF and mail it in to the company with your insurance claim. Or, if
		your insurance company has taken the initiative to become a StockPyle partner, the information
		can be emailed directly to your claim rep with the simple click of a button!</p>
	<p>StockPyle is a great way to keep track of all sorts of information, such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Books: Collecting Phillip K Dick novels, and can't remember which ones you already have?</li>
		<li>Groceries: Access StockPyle from your phone when you're shopping to know what you already have!</li>
		<li>Home Inventory: Insurance Claims, Roommates who like to borrow, you name it!</li>
	</ul>
