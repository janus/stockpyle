StockPyle: Personal Inventory Tracking
===

This app had some big aspirations going for it. I wanted to make an app that
local insurance companies could brand and have their customers sign up for.
Then, the app could generate PDF printouts in the format the companies wanted,
and would ask users for the specific information the company tracked.

But, I never got that far.

This app uses CodeIgniter 2, Modular Extensions, and Tank Auth.
